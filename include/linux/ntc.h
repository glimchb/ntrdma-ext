 * The channel implementation may coalesce interrupts to the peer driver,

 *
 * The upper layer should attempt to minimize the frequency of signal requests.
 * Signal requests may be implemented as small operations processed as dma
 * requests, and many small dma requests may impact the throughput performance
 * of the channel.  Furthermore, the channel may not coalesce interrupts, and a
 * high frequency of interrupts may impact the scheduling performance of the
